#### Coding and pull request guidelines
1. Commit messages should follow the following format `(fix|feature|clean) Commit message`
2. Code should at least have function comments, including very brief description and preferably return value
3. It would be nice to name branches according to `(fix|feature)/BRANCHNAME`
